# sub_file_generation_via_whisper
Generating a subtitle file for videos using OpenAI Whisper, but with the additional step of using user defined timestamps for isolating the audio segments for transcription.
Intention is to ensure more accurate timing of the subtitles, specifically for further use with subs2srs for generating Anki flashcards with Morphman readability analysis.
